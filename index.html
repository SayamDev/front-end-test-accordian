                This can be a bit tricky, because there's two things you need to keep in mind. Where's best for both your broadband and your Wi-Fi signal. Here are some tips to help you decide.
                <br>
                Best for your broadband signal
                <br>
                First of all, find your [master telephone socket]
                <a href="(https://www.google.com/search?q=master+telephone+socket&oq=master+telephone+socket).">(https://www.google.com/search?q=master+telephone+socket&oq=master+telephone+socket).</a>
                 This is the best socket to connect your router to. It's usually closest to where the telephone line comes into your home or office. You don't have to connect your router to this one. But you'll get the best broadband performance from it, especially if you have a poor quality or long line.
